üñêüñêÔ∏èHello World! I am Kieu [Surname/Last Name] Chin Yew [Given Name/First Name].

I am a curriculum specialist striving to achieve the sustained learning and use of the official Mother Tongue Languages, namely Chinese-Mandarin, Malay and Tamil, in Singapore.

Currently, I am actively engaged in the exploration of an integrated learning environment driven by AI solutions to facilitate language learning as well as the promotion of the relevance of languages applied in real-world contexts. 

I am starting my exploration into programming and would be keen to learn more about EdTech, computational linguistics, software and application development. As I progress in my programming skills, I guess this profile would also evolve accordingly.

I can be contacted at my LinkedIn account: https://www.linkedin.com/in/chin-yew-kieu-q-jinyao/
